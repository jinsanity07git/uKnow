2.2.13

Fuel consumption and pollutant emissions

Detailed vehicle characteristics for fuel consumption and pollutant emissions can be specified. NETSIM and FRESIM now use the same tables for fuel consumption and emissions. Record Type 172 is used to specify the data tables for both NETSIM and FRESIM. The fuel consumption rates can be specified for autos, trucks, and buses. Only one rate of HC emissions, CO emissions, and NOx emissions can be set for all types of vehicles.

High Hydrocarbon (**HC**) **emissions** 

Carbon Monoxide Emissions

 Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions
